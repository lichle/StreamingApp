# StreamingApp

This application is a demo of streaming Video.
The application gets data from Android camera, then converts it to a well-known format and sends it to Streaming Engine to conform. You can install VCL on a machin which has the same network to watch the video in real-time </br>
You first install Wowza Engine to your local machine (https://www.wowza.com/). </br>
Then please update the values of SERVER_URL, USER_NAME, PASSWORD to your local machine (they are in Constants class). </br>
